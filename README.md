# Dev-Up-Space
Welcome to the dev-up mentorship program. This will be our main material.
The structure of this material requires you to be entirely self-driven.
Stick through to the very end and you will come out a junior developer. A developer non-the-less.
This is new information to you. It will feel strange and complex, but with repetition as you grow in your career, they will get normal. So take heart.

## Intro to Computer Science

In this module, we will introduce basic computer science concepts. We will cover all the areas required to get you to the point of understanding what a computer scientist does.

## Data Structures

A data structure is a logical concept that introduces a way to organize data so the data can be immediately available to the processor for required calculations. This module will cover ways in which data is stored for efficient search and retrieval.
