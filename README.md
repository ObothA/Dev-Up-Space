# Dev-Up-Space
Welcome to the dev-up mentorship program. This will be our main material.
The structure of this material requires you to be entirely self-driven.
Stick through to the very end and you will come out a junior developer. A developer non-the-less.
This is new information to you. It will feel strange and complex, but with repetition as you grow in your career, it will get normal. So take heart. Also, take this slow; one step at a time...

## Intro to Computer Science

In this module, we will introduce basic computer science concepts. We will cover all the areas required to get you to the point of understanding what a computer scientist does.

## Intro to Programming

Computer programming is the act of writing a sequence of instructions to a computer to perform a specific task. This module will cover the basics of programming and provide an overview of computer programming.

## Data Structures

A data structure is a logical concept that introduces a way to organize data so the data can be immediately available to the processor for required calculations. This module will cover ways in which data is stored for efficient search and retrieval.

## Algorithms

An algorithm is a set of finite rules or instructions to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations

## Recursion

Recursion is a method where the solution to a problem depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem. We have seen that functions are named procedures which perform distinct tasks or services. This module will address recursion as a technique involving the use of functions.

## => You are now ready. Build a fullstack To-Do App.
- Technology stack; Reactjs, Expressjs, Knexjs, add authentication using passportjs, postgresql(database) and track all this on git.
- In this app, I should be able to add a task, delete a task, mark a task as complete. Another user shouldn't delete my tasks or mark my tasks as complete or incomplete.
- If you want to, you can add test cases to the application. Highly encouraged.
- You can now showcase this application and code at interviews and, should be just fine... I'm proud of you!
