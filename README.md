# Dev-Up-Space
Welcome to the dev-up mentorship program. This will be our main material.
The structure of this material requires you to be entirely self-driven.
Stick through to the very end and you will come out a junior developer. A developer non-the-less.
This is new information to you. It will feel strange and complex, but with repetition as you grow in your career, they will get normal. So take heart.

## Intro to Computer Science

In this module, we will introduce basic computer science concepts. We will cover all the areas required to get you to the point of understanding what a computer scientist does.

## Intro to Programming

Computer programming is the act of writing a sequence of instructions to a computer to perform a specific task. This module will cover the basics of programming and provide an overview of computer programming.

## Data Structures

A data structure is a logical concept that introduces a way to organize data so the data can be immediately available to the processor for required calculations. This module will cover ways in which data is stored for efficient search and retrieval.

## Recursion

Recursion is a method where the solution to a problem depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem. We have seen that functions are named procedures which perform distinct tasks or services. This module will address recursion as a technique involving the use of functions.
